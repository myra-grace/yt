          I started playing ukulele around 2008. Before that, I played guitar, a
          little bit of piano, and then bass. The great thing about playing
          multiple instruments is that the knowledge is transferable ðŸ§  It's a
          real thing! Search up "transferable skills."

          How I started my YouTube channel was a mistake. I couldn't always find
          the tabs or chords of songs I wanted to play. So I started finding
          them by ear and recording them by memory or through audio recording.
          One day, I decided to arrange a mini tutorial for a tune from a movie
          which seemed impossible to find! And to my surprise, it got lots of
          views ðŸ‘€
        </p>

        <p>
          I continued to record mini tutorials. Record both for my future self
          ... since I couldn't remember all these songs anymore, and also for
          anyone curious about percussive playing! What really brought a ton of
          viewers was a request from a friend. "In Your Arms." From there, you
          guys came along and showed much love ðŸ’œ
        </p>
        <p>
          I remember when I started experimenting with percussive playing. I
          wished there was a place I could go to learn and talk about it. Well,
          turns out I'm not the only one. So here we are! Welcome aboard the noodle_ship ðŸš¢
